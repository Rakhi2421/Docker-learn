## What is a Container?
A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes:
- Application code
- Runtime
- System libraries
- Dependencies

Containers run consistently across environments such as **development, testing, and production**.  
It is made up of layers of images.  
It has mostly linux base image, because it's small in size.  
Application image on top.  
> Postgres:10.10  --> Layer- application Image
>
> alphine-30 --> Layer - Linux base Image

## What is Image?
It is a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.  
It is portable artifact, easily shared and moved.  
It makes development and deployment more efficient.  

### Interview Key Point:
> Containers eliminate the “it works on my machine” problem by packaging everything together.

---

## 📦 Container vs Image

| Image | Container |
|------|----------|
| Blueprint / template | Running instance of an image |
| Read-only | Read-write |
| Created once | Can be started, stopped, deleted |

### Example:
- **Docker Image** → NGINX image
- **Docker Container** → Running NGINX server

### Interview Tip:
> An image is static, a container is dynamic.

---

## 🆚 Docker vs Virtual Machine

| Docker | Virtual Machine |
|------|----------------|
| Lightweight | Heavy |
| Shares host OS kernel | Separate OS per VM |
| Faster startup | Slow startup |
| Less resource usage | High resource usage |
| Virtualize Applications | Virtualize application and OS Kernel |

### Interview Key Point:
> Docker containers are faster and more efficient than virtual machines because they don’t require a full OS.

## 🐳 Docker Engine

The **Docker Engine** is the core component of Docker that enables building, running, and managing containers.  
It follows a **client–server architecture** and consists of three main parts:

- Docker Server (Docker Daemon)
- Docker REST API
- Docker CLI

---

### 🔹 Docker Server (Docker Daemon)

The **Docker Server**, also known as the **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**, performs all the core Docker operations.

### Responsibilities:
- Pulls Docker images from registries
- Builds Docker images
- Creates and manages containers
- Manages Docker networks and volumes

---

### 🔸 Components Inside Docker Server

- Container Runtime
- Volumes
- Network
- Image Builder

#### 🧩 Container Runtime
- Responsible for running containers
- Manages the **container lifecycle** (create, start, stop, delete)
- Uses container runtime such as `containerd`

**Interview Point:**  
> The container runtime is responsible for executing containers.

---

#### 💾 Volumes
- Used to **persist data** generated by containers
- Data remains available even if the container is removed
- Recommended for production workloads

**Interview Point:**  
> Volumes solve the problem of container data loss.

---

#### 🌐 Networks
- Enables communication between containers
- Provides isolation and security
- Supports multiple network types (bridge, host, overlay)

**Interview Point:**  
> Docker networking enables secure container-to-container communication.

---

#### 🏗️ Image Builder
- Builds Docker images using Dockerfiles
- Converts application code into a reusable Docker image

**Interview Point:**  
> Docker images are built using Dockerfile instructions.

---

### 🔹 Docker REST API

The **Docker API** allows communication between the Docker Client and Docker Server.

- Uses RESTful APIs
- Can be accessed locally or remotely
- Enables automation and integration with CI/CD tools

**Interview Point:**  
> Docker CLI communicates with Docker Daemon via Docker REST API.

---

### 🔹 Docker CLI (Command Line Interface)

The **Docker CLI** is the user-facing tool used to interact with Docker.

- Executes commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker pull`
- Sends requests to Docker Daemon through Docker API
- Does not directly run containers

**Interview Point:**  
> Docker CLI is just a client; all execution happens on Docker Daemon.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Docker Engine is the core of Docker
- Docker Daemon does the actual work
- Docker API enables communication
- Docker CLI provides user interaction
- Runtime, volumes, networks, and image builder are managed by Docker Server

---

## 🎯 Interview One-Line Answer

**What is Docker Engine?**  
> Docker Engine is a client–server application responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers.

---

## 🛠️ Main Docker Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `docker version` | Check Docker installation |
| `docker pull` | Download image |
| `docker run` | Create & run container |
| `docker ps` | List running containers |
| `docker ps -a` | List all containers |
| `docker images` | List images |
| `docker stop` | Stop container |
| `docker rm` | Remove container |
| `docker rmi` | Remove image |
| `docker start` | Start container |
| `docker exec -it` | login to container |
| `docker logs` | To see logs of container |

### Interview Tip:
> `docker run` = pull + create + start

---

## Container Port V/S Host Port

Multiple containers can run on your host machine.  
Your laptop has certain ports available  
Maybe a change to get conflicts when we use same port on host machine. So Port Binding comes into the play..  

Host Port : 5000, Application running on container with port: 3000

docker run -p 5000:3000 redis , then you can access the website using hostip:hostport.


## 🧑‍💻 Develop With Containers

Docker allows developers to:
- Use the same environment everywhere
- Avoid dependency conflicts
- Improve collaboration

### Example Use Case:
- Developer runs application in Docker
- QA and Production use the **same image**

### Interview Key Point:
> Docker ensures environment consistency across the SDLC.

---

## 🔁 Run Multiple Containers using Docker Compose

**Docker Compose** is used to run **multiple containers** using a single YAML file.

### Example Use Case:
- Web application + Database
- Frontend + Backend + Cache

### Benefits:
- One command to start all services
- Easy configuration management

```bash
docker-compose up
```
